# Rivière Living Architecture E-Commerce Demo Application

This is a demo application used as part of the [Living Architecture](https://living-architecture.dev) project.

The `.riviere` folder contains an example of the [extraction workflow](https://living-architecture.dev/extract/steps/) — a 6-step process for extracting architecture from codebases into a Rivière graph.

See the [live demo](https://living-architecture.dev/eclair/?demo=true) to explore the extracted architecture.
